# A/B Testing: Facebook Ads vs AdWords (2019)

## Overview
This project applies an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of two digital marketing channels: Facebook Ads and AdWords, using daily campaign data from 2019.

The goal is to determine whether observed differences in key performance metrics are statistically significant and to translate those findings into actionable marketing recommendations.

Rather than focusing on platform-specific trends, this analysis emphasizes experimentation design, statistical reasoning, and business interpretation. These skills are transferable across industries and time periods.

## Business Questions
- Does one channel generate a significantly higher click-through rate (CTR)?
- Does one channel outperform the other in conversion rate?
- Are observed differences both statistically significant and practically meaningful?

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains 365 daily observations from 2019 with campaign-level performance metrics, including impressions, clicks, conversions, CTR, conversion rate, and cost per click (CPC).

A complete historical dataset was intentionally chosen to enable:
- Fully reproducible analysis
- Clear hypothesis testing under stable conditions
- Focus on methodology rather than short-term platform fluctuations

Detailed column definitions are available in `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

## Methodology
1. Define null and alternative hypotheses for key KPIs  
2. Validate assumptions and select appropriate statistical tests  
3. Conduct significance testing and evaluate effect sizes  
4. Interpret results in a business context  
5. Provide data-driven recommendations  

The analysis prioritizes clarity, correctness, and decision-making relevance over visual complexity.
